# Instant-Delivery-Pricing-Case-Study

Problem: 
Given a groceries vendor who is listed in Instant Delivery Company X platform, we would like you to help to define multiple pricing scheme (delivery fee) for that vendor with information as below: 

- Commission rate for the vendor: 25%
- Delivery fee should range from: 0.99 - 4.99
- Average food value per order: 40$
- Target revenue per order: $12
Revenue per order = Commission rate * Average basket value + Delivery fee

Question:
1. Please design 3 pricing schemes (include the principle of the design with numbers to support) that can meet the target revenue per order. Please list down all the assumptions that you have made and why you have made them (if applicable)

2. Since now that you have identified 3 different pricing schemes, what would be the KPIs that you will use to evaluate the most optimal pricing scheme? Please indicate why you have chosen these KPIs as well.

3. If you have to conduct A/B testing to define the best pricing scheme, how will you conduct this A/B testing?
